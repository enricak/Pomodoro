Study buddy!! Teaching someone else what you just learned always helps you understand the material better. Also, connecting back what you just learned to previous topics helps you understand the meaning of what you just learned so you can remember it for longer. This study buddy helps you achieve just that!

This is the basic Pomodoro functionality timer. At the end of the cycle, this page will automatically jump to the Review page. You can also conveniently refer to the Review Page by pressing the button below.

At the end of each cycle, the program prompts users to input conceptual connections, weak points, and summaries. This engages the user to recall what they've learned by thinking about the meaning of the information they're learning and connecting it to other information they've already learned.
